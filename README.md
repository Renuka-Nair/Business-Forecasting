# Business Forecasting - Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices: Sugar, Jam, Honey, Chocolate, and Confectionery for Norway

1. This project is to forecast the HICP value for the basket goods mentioned above in Norway by processing the data from 2010-2021. The index tracks the prices of goods such as coffee, tobacco, meat, fruit, household appliances, cars, pharmaceuticals, electricity, clothing and many other widely used products. Thus it is also used as an Inflation Measure in the euro area and forecasting HICP can be used to understand inflation rates in the area.

2. The project forecast could be a Point forecast for HICP in the next year (2022) but may also include a confidence interval.

3. The accuracy of the forecast will be measured using one the below measures :
MAD  Mean Absolute Value , 
MSE Mean Squared Error,
RMSE Root Mean Squared Error,
MAPE Mean Absolute Percentage Error,
MPE Mean Percentage Error 
. We are leaning more towards using RMSE as an accuracy measure as we would like an accuracy measure that would penalise us for errors in this particular prediction.

4. The data was obtained from the economic research website FRED. (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CP0118NOM086NEST)
The frequency of the data is monthly starting from 2010 till 2021 August. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices category "Sugar, Jam, Honey, Chocolate, and Confectionery (01.1.8)" is a classification of nondurable goods that includes cane or beet sugar, unrefined or refined sugar, powdered sugar, crystallized sugar, or sugar lumps; jams, marmalades, chocolates etc.
